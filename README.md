# A* Search Algorithm

This is an implementation of A* search algorithm for path-finding in a grid
that alows 8-way movements.

## Running instruction

To run the program, you can just run `a-star-impl.py` without any parameters, as long as `sample_input.py` is under the same diretory and contains the variables `maze`, `start`, and `end`.   

The `sample_input.py` file contains the sample input, which includes the maze (0 indicates space to walk on, 1 indicates a block/wall), the starting point and ending point, you may change the input for testing.
